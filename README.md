# Earthquake-Predictions
An attempt to predict earthquakes using seismic data. While this is an impossible task, I decided to share this repo to demonstrate some of my skills in writing reports, so I'd recommend focusing on Fitzptrick-Report.ipynb. This was one of my first forays into machine learning, so I've learned a lot since when I made this.
